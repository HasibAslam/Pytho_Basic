Where is the Ghost Ship? Who has seen it? Who has lived to speak of it? Who can tell us of the perils it poses? 
Who will dive to learn its secrets? And of those, you ask, who will survive and what will be left of them? The IT 
dept. has requested you send requests c/o the web page. Just send an email addressed to Bob c/o IT Services 
and he will get back to you. The problem? Apparently in the usr/source/files directory, someone left a bagel.
