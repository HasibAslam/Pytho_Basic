Nobody knows where the treasure is. It is hidden. Perhaps a shark ate it. We do not know. If so it is lost.There 
may have been gold and jewels. Maybe platinum. Or some kind of stock options. But it will never be found. If you see

Jr. can vouch for that. He used to buy from Ms. Slappy. But now he only buys his pork from Dr. Samuels.
