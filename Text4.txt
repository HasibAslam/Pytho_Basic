Your Words Per Minute is calculated by subtracting the number of errors you make from your raw score at the end 
of the test. Accuracy is more important than sheer speed! Too many errors will really bring your WPM down. While 
word processors and spell checkers make it easier to correct mistakes today, accuracy is still your chief concern. 
Don't go so fast that you get sloppy! Your speed will naturally increase with practice as you go.
